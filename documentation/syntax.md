### Syntax

<p>Iguana supports data-dependent grammars at its core. Data-dependent grammars
are an extension of context-free grammar that support arbitrary computation,
parametrized nonterminals, variable binding and constraints. These powerful
features allow the user to simulate hand-written parsers, and also implement
various disambiguation constructs. In this section, we present the syntax
of Iguana for data-dependent grammars.</p>
